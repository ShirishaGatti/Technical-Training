String base3 = Integer.toString(n, 3);


/*It then divides your number by the base repeatedly, taking remainders, until the whole number is converted.

Java’s Integer.toString(int i, int radix) method takes:

i → the number you want to convert

radix → the base (must be between 2 and 36)*/



"I can use 1 << i to generate a power of 2 without Math.pow"
Math.pow() return double which is slower
